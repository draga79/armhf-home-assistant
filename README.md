# Home Assistant Docker Image for armhf

Home Assistant Docker image for armhf arch (Armbian on Orange Pi PC, Banana Pro, etc).
Needed for a Docker swarm as the generic ARM build gets rejected by the swarm manager.
Includes software for Fritz! presence detection.

Based on lroguet/rpi-home-assistant

Configuration is on /config.

Enjoy!
